# Data Mining - Rule Mining

The main purpose of this report is to create a system that can
find diseases, given a set of symptoms. The dataset itself may
have come from real patients, however, this is not cleared by
the author. Nevertheless, the symptoms and diseases provided
in the data set do make sense logically. The methods which
will be used to find the association rules are, the Frequent
Pattern (FP) Growth algorithm, and the Apriori algorithm. Specifically, this report uses Orange as a tool, which
uses the FP algorithm with bucketing optimization for
efficiency. Weka is another tool that uses the Apriori algorithm
to find association rules for our given dataset.
